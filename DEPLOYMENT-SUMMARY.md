## 🚀 How to Test Locally

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create `.env.local`** with your Firebase config

3. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test these flows**:
   - ✅ Sign up with new account
   - ✅ Sign in with existing account
   - ✅ View user dashboard at `/account/dashboard`
   - ✅ Add items to cart
   - ✅ Complete checkout flow
   - ✅ See thank you page after "purchase"
   - ✅ Access admin dashboard (if email is in ADMIN_EMAILS)
   - ✅ Upload test image in admin panel

---

## 🌐 Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect GitHub repo to Vercel**
2. **Add all Firebase environment variables** in Project Settings
3. **Deploy!**

The build will succeed once environment variables are set. The build errors you see locally are expected when env vars are missing.
